# Difference between ` {:#?} ` and ` {} ` in Rust

` {:#?} ` and ` {} ` are different formatting specifiers used with Rust's `println!` macro (and other formatting macros). They control how a value is converted into a string for output.

Here's the difference:

1.  **`{}` (Display Trait)**:
    *   This is the "standard" or "user-facing" formatting.
    *   It uses the `fmt::Display` trait.
    *   It's intended for cases where you want to show a value in a way that's meaningful and concise to an end-user.
    *   Many primitive types (like integers, floats, strings) implement `Display` by default.
    *   Custom types need to explicitly `impl fmt::Display for MyType` to use this formatting.

    **Example:**
    ```rust
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }

    // You would need to implement Display for Point
    // impl std::fmt::Display for Point {
    //     fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
    //         write!(f, "({}, {})", self.x, self.y)
    //     }
    // }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
        // If Display is implemented, this might print "Point: (10, 20)"
        // println!("Point: {}", p);
    }
    ```

2.  **`{:#?}` (Debug Trait - "Pretty Print")**:
    *   This is for "debug" formatting, often used by developers to inspect the internal state of a value.
    *   It uses the `fmt::Debug` trait.
    *   The `#` modifier specifically requests "pretty-printing," which means it will add line breaks and indentation to make the output more readable, especially for complex data structures like structs, enums, and vectors.
    *   To use ` {:#?} ` or ` {:?} `, your type must derive or manually implement the `Debug` trait. You can easily do this for most custom types by adding `#[derive(Debug)]` above your struct or enum definition.

    **Example:**
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug)] // Required for {:?} and {:#?}
    struct Account {
        id: i32,
        name: String,
    }

    fn main() {
        let account = Account { id: 1, name: String::from("me") };

        // Normal debug format
        println!("{:?}", account);
        // Output: Account { id: 1, name: "me" }

        // Pretty debug format
        println!("{:#?}", account);
        // Output:
        // Account {
        //     id: 1,
        //     name: "me",
        // }
    }
    ```

In summary:

*   Use ` {} ` with `Display` for clean, user-friendly output.
*   Use ` {:#?} ` with `Debug` for developer-friendly, well-formatted inspection of data structures.
*   The type must implement the corresponding trait (`Display` or `Debug`) for the formatting to work. `#[derive(Debug)]` is a convenient way to get `Debug` for your custom types.

## Example of their difference

Here's a concise example demonstrating the difference:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // Required for {:?} and {:#?}
struct MyData {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    values: Vec<i32>,
}

impl std::fmt::Display for MyData {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Data: {} ({})", self.name, self.id)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let data = MyData {
        id: 1,
        name: String::from("Example Item"),
        values: vec![10, 20, 30],
    };

    println!("Using {{}}: {}", data);
    println!("Using {{:?}}: {:?}", data);
    println!("Using {{:#?}}: {:#?}", data);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Using {}: Data: Example Item (1)
Using {:?}: MyData { id: 1, name: "Example Item", values: [10, 20, 30] }
Using {:#?}: MyData {
    id: 1,
    name: "Example Item",
    values: [
        10,
        20,
        30,
    ],
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`{}` (Display)**: Shows a user-friendly string (`"Data: Example Item (1)"`) as defined by the `impl Display for MyData` block.
*   **`{:?}` (Debug)**: Shows a basic, single-line representation of the struct's internal state, derived automatically with `#[derive(Debug)]`.
*   **`{:#?}` (Pretty Debug)**: Shows a multi-line, indented, and more readable representation of the struct's internal state, also derived from `#[derive(Debug)]`.

## Explicit `impl std::fmt::Display`

No, for `std::fmt::Display`, **you generally have to implement it manually**.

Unlike `std::fmt::Debug`, which can often be automatically derived using `#[derive(Debug)]`, the `Display` trait requires an explicit `impl` block. This is because `Display` is meant for user-facing output, and the "best" way to display a type is often subjective and depends on your application's specific needs. Rust doesn't assume how you want your type to be presented to an end-user, so it requires you to define it yourself.

In the example above, the `impl std::fmt::Display for MyData` block explicitly defines how a `MyData` struct should be formatted when used with `{}`, resulting in `"Data: Example Item (1)"`. If this `impl` block were removed, `println!("{}", data)` would result in a compile-time error, stating that `MyData` does not implement `Display`.
